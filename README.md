# URL Shortener (API based)

This is a repository holding the code for a pyBCN workshop using Django and Django REST Framework.

## Requirements

It is not intended to teach Django, so, if you don't have knowledge on it, it would be recommendable to practice the [Django tutorials](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/) or the [DjangoGirls tutorial](https://www.gitbook.com/book/djangogirls/djangogirls-tutorial/details) to get in touch with basic Django setup and concepts.

The workshop is based on Django 1.9.6 and Django REST Framework 3.3.3, so you'll need a Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5 based environment.
Creating such an environment with any virtual environment manager is not the point of this document.

You should also have a [SQLite installation](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm) on your computer.

## Setup

For the proper setup, clone this repository:

    git clone github.com/BCNDojos/url-shortener-api.git
    
Once this is cloned, you can install all requirements in your environment by using the following commands:

    cd url-shortener-api
    pip install -r requirements.txt
